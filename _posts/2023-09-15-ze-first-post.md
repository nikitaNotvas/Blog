Throught out the entire  summer I had several things in my mind. The first of them was to finish my summer internship.2nd thing I had my mind on was to buy a spaceship which cost $125. Last thing I was thinking about during summer is whether I will go to college or not.


The internship I did was for my school. My work was to make a workshop on 3d printing, I finished all of the work on 1 week but i was paid hourly so i was watching One piece all time. Most of my time in class it was quiet because there were only 4 people in the room. It was nice.
